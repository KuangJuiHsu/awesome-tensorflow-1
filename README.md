## Benchmarks

- [convnet-benchmarks](https://github.com/soumith/convnet-benchmarks/issues/66) - Some preliminary benchmarks comparing TensorFlow to the Torch and Neon libraries.


## Developer Tools

- [tdb](https://github.com/ericjang/tdb) - TensorDebugger is a visual debugger that extends TensorFlow with breakpoints and real-time visualizations of data flowing through the graph.


## Getting Started

- [skflow](https://github.com/google/skflow) - A simple interface for TensorFlow mimicking Scikit Learn.


## Images

- [neural-style](https://github.com/anishathalye/neural-style) - Transfers styles between images via an implementation of [A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.06576v2.pdf).
- [show_attend_and_tell](https://github.com/jazzsaxmafia/show_attend_and_tell.tensorflow) - Image captioning via the [Show, Attend, and Tell](http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03044) model.
- [sketch-rnn](https://github.com/hardmaru/sketch-rnn/) - Generates samples from svg stroke data; comes with an excellent Chinese character demo.


## Reinforcement Learning

- [DeepLearningVideoGames](https://github.com/asrivat1/DeepLearningVideoGames) - An implementation of [DeepQ learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5602) for pong and tetris games.


## Text

- [char-rnn-tensorflow](https://github.com/sherjilozair/char-rnn-tensorflow) - A character-level language model that can generate examples similar to those in the training text.
